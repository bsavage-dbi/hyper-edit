# 📝 hyper-edit

Makes opening the Wordpress edit page blazing fast 🔥

![hyper-edit](images/screenshot2.png)

Hyper Island has a lot of web pages and making edits to a specific page can take ages. Finding the page, searching for it in Wordpress, opening it, etc can take 30-60 seconds. With this extension, you can open the page directly; blazing fast 🔥

How to use it:

1. Click the HI icon 
2. Click on the edit button to open the Wordpress editor page

This only works on pages starting with `www.hyperisland.com`, and not any of the Hyper Island subdomains like Toolbox, etc. 

## install
